# Sensai: Skill Radar - Evidence-Driven Hiring Dashboard

üîç Context
Recruiters need to make confident and quick hiring decisions, but raw test scores often fail to provide a complete picture of a candidate's abilities. Sensai's "Skill Radar" is a visual, evidence-driven dashboard designed to compress hours of resume reading into minutes. It allows hiring teams to see the detailed evidence behind every skill, providing a deeper understanding of a candidate's proficiency.

üéØ Mission
Sensai's Skill Radar Dashboard automatically translates candidate assessment data into an interactive radar chart. Recruiters can click on any skill (e.g., SQL, Data Structures) to reveal the underlying evidence. This evidence includes code snippets, test run histories, error-fix timelines, peer-review comments, and performance trends over multiple attempts.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
Evidence-Driven Drill-downs: One-click access to specific artifacts (commits, rationales, replays) that justify each skill score.

Signal Density: Combines multiple metrics (accuracy, efficiency, and iteration quality) into a single, normalized score per skill.

Recruiter Efficiency: The full candidate profile loads in under 5 seconds, and a PDF one-pager can be exported with a single click.

Evidence Integrity: Automatically flags potential plagiarism or over-reliance on AI, with the option for reviewers to override with notes.

Accessibility: Designed with dark-mode readiness, keyboard navigation, and WCAG-AA compliant PDF templates.
